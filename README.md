# lexie

a ML-style programming language based on the calculus of inductive constructions type theory

still very early in its development so don't expect much

for now there is no parser whatsoever so the sample program is hardcoded in `CLI`

## run

```sh
dune exec lexie
```

Lexie's development does not involve any large language model.
